The Interview Trainer Agent is an AI-powered capstone project developed by Soumik Saran Nath from ITER SOA University, designed to address the shortcomings of generic interview preparation tools. Unlike traditional platforms that offer one-size-fits-all advice, this project delivers a personalized and intelligent coaching experience tailored to the user’s resume, job role, and experience level. Built using IBM Cloud Lite services, the agent leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM’s Granite foundation model to simulate the experience of a human HR coach. When a user uploads their resume or mentions a specific job title, the system retrieves real-world interview content—technical questions, behavioral scenarios, and model answers—from trusted sources like job portals and professional communities. These insights are then processed to generate customized preparation kits that help users practice smarter and feel more confident. The solution is deployed using a serverless architecture via IBM Cloud Functions, with additional components like Watson NLP, Object Storage, and prompt engineering to fine-tune responses. The result is a highly scalable, cloud-native system that supports role-specific training. Key features include personalized questions, behavioral tips, real-time feedback, and adaptive guidance. The project also explores future enhancements such as voice-based mock interviews, multilingual support, real-time scoring, and integration with job portals and resume builders. This intelligent agent stands out as a forward-thinking solution that not only supports individual career development but also showcases the power of agentic AI in education and professional coaching.
